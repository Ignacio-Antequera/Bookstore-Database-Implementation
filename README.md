# Bookstore Management System

## Description

The Bookstore Management System is a database-driven application designed to manage various aspects of a bookstore chain. It includes features for tracking book inventory, managing employees and their positions, handling cafe items, and scheduling shifts. This system facilitates efficient management of book sales, cafe sales, employee schedules, and store operations.

## Problem Statement

Managing a bookstore chain involves several complex tasks, such as keeping track of book inventory, coordinating employee schedules, and handling cafe operations. The goal of this project is to develop a database-backed application that streamlines these processes, enabling efficient management and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- Database Management System: [Specify the DBMS you used, e.g., MySQL]
- Programming Language: [Specify the programming language you used, e.g., SQL]
- Version Control: [Specify the version control system you used, e.g., Git]
- Libraries/Frameworks: [Specify any relevant libraries or frameworks, e.g., JDBC for Java]

## Approach

1. **Database Schema Design:** Create a comprehensive database schema to capture bookstore-related entities, relationships, and attributes.

2. **Database Creation:** Set up the database using the chosen DBMS and create tables to represent different entities such as books, employees, shifts, etc.

3. **Insert Statements:** Populate the database with sample data using SQL insert statements to simulate real-world scenarios.

4. **Queries:** Develop a set of SQL queries to test various functionalities of the system, such as retrieving book information, analyzing sales data, and managing employee schedules.

## How to Use

1. **Database Setup:** Import the provided database schema and sample data into your chosen DBMS.

2. **Run Queries:** Execute the sample SQL queries provided in the testing file to explore the functionality of the Bookstore Management System.

## Queries and Functionality

The provided testing file includes sample SQL queries that demonstrate different aspects of the Bookstore Management System, such as querying book information, analyzing cafe sales, managing employee schedules, and more. Each query is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and expected output.
