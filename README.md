# Bookstore Management System Using SQL

## Description

This project is a database-driven application designed to manage various aspects of a bookstore chain using SQL. It includes features for tracking book inventory, managing employees and their positions, handling cafe items, and scheduling shifts. This system facilitates efficient management of book sales, cafe sales, employee schedules, and store operations.

This project holds immense value for me as it showcases my journey of creating a solid database system for a bookstore. By designing tables, defining relationships, and crafting efficient queries, I've gained hands-on experience in database management and SLQ. This project not only highlights my technical skills but also demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world challenges, contributing to my growth as a developer.

## Problem Statement

Managing a bookstore chain involves several complex tasks, such as keeping track of book inventory, coordinating employee schedules, and handling cafe operations. The goal of this project is to develop a database-backed application that streamlines these processes, enabling efficient management and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- Database Management System: MySQL
- Programming Language: SQL
- Version Control: Git

## Repository Structure

- Database Structure: Folder containing all the data and tables that form our database.
- Database Implementation: Folder containing SQL queries to explore the functionality of the Bookstore Management System.
- ER Diagrams: Visually representation of tables and the relationships between them.

## Approach

1. **Database Schema Design:** Create a comprehensive database schema to capture bookstore-related entities, relationships, and attributes.

2. **Database Creation:** Set up the database using the chosen DBMS and create tables to represent different entities such as books, employees, shifts, etc.

3. **Insert Statements:** Populate the database with sample data using SQL insert statements to simulate real-world scenarios.

4. **Queries:** Develop a set of SQL queries to test various functionalities of the system, such as retrieving book information, analyzing sales data, and managing employee schedules.

## How to Use

1. **Database Setup:** Import the provided database schema and sample data into your chosen DBMS.

2. **Run Queries:** Execute the sample SQL queries provided in the testing file to explore the functionality of the Bookstore Management System.

## Queries and Functionality

The provided testing file includes sample SQL queries that demonstrate different aspects of the Bookstore Management System, such as querying book information, analyzing cafe sales, managing employee schedules, and more. Each query is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and expected output.
